# Touchless
My take on Murtaza's Workshop's cv keyboard! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzXZVFqEE2I

Goals: Touchless keyboard interaction via computer vision and speech recognition

One-handed mode: Test selecting keys

Two-handed mode: 
- Aim with left hand.
- Leave right hand in thumbs-up position.
- Press thumb down to click (it's by the distance between your thumb and pinky, but that's the envisioned approach).

- Typing sound from Zapsplat
